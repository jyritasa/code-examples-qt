/*  This is a task for school where you have to emulate the classic number guessing game:
 *    - Number is between 1 and 100
 *    - You have 10 guesses, after that you lose the game.
 *    - After every wrong guess the program lets you know if you guessed high or low.
 *
 *  The program runs one million emulations for both methods of trying to guess the right number:
 *    - First method attempts to guess the number half-way of the possible range after every wrong guess.
 *    - Second second attempts to guesss numbers at random after every wrong answer.
 *
 *  The Program returns number of successes and failures and calculates propability of success for both.
